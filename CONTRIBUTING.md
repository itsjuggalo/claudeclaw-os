## Versioning & changelog

ClaudeClaw follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org): **MAJOR** for a breaking
change, **MINOR** for backward-compatible features, **PATCH** for fixes. A dependency's
own version bump (e.g. the Agent SDK) only moves our MAJOR if it breaks our public
config/API — it usually doesn't.

`package.json` is the single source of truth for the version; code reads it via
`src/version.ts` (`VERSION`). Never hardcode a version string elsewhere.

**Commit messages use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):**
`feat(scope): ...`, `fix(scope): ...`, `security: ...`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`.
Squash-merge each PR with a single conventional-commit title so one PR becomes one clean
changelog line that links back to the PR number.

**The CHANGELOG is generated from that commit history — never hand-edit it.** Cutting a
release (version bump, changelog generation, tagging) is a maintainer-only step;
contributors just need a clean conventional-commit PR title.

## Adding a migration

Use the `add-migration` skill from within Claude Code:

```
/add-migration
```

or write a prompt like `add a new migration`.

The skill will walk you through picking a version bump (current / patch / minor / major),
naming the migration, and will create the migration file, update `migrations/version.json`,
sync `package.json`, and add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.

After the skill finishes, open the generated file and implement the `run()` function.

## Adding a CLI

Every shipped agent CLI (`src/*-cli.ts`) MUST have a descriptor, or the build fails.

1. Define a `descriptor: CliDescriptor` for it in `src/cli-descriptors.ts` (mirror an existing one) and add it to `allDescriptors`.
2. Import that descriptor in the CLI file and wire `--help` to `renderHelp(descriptor)`.
3. Run `npm run gen:cli-docs` and commit the regenerated `docs/agent-cli-reference.md`.

A coverage-guard test fails if any `*-cli.ts` lacks a registered descriptor, and a drift-guard test fails if `docs/agent-cli-reference.md` is out of date. Command *syntax* lives only in the descriptor (surfaced via the injected CLI index, `--help`, and the generated doc) — do NOT duplicate it into persona/CLAUDE.md files, which carry doctrine only.

## Running tests

Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). Make sure dependencies are installed first:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the full test suite once:

```bash
npm test
```

Run in watch mode during development:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Run with coverage report:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Run a specific test file:

```bash
npx vitest run src/migrations.test.ts
```

## Test layout

Tests live next to the source files they cover:

```
src/
  migrations.ts
  migrations.test.ts
  db.ts
  db.test.ts
  ...
```

Integration tests that hit external APIs (Telegram, etc.) are in files ending with `.integration.test.ts`. They are included in the normal test run but skip automatically when the required credentials are absent.

## Writing tests

- Use `describe` / `it` blocks. Nest `describe` blocks to group related cases.
- Use `beforeEach` / `afterEach` for setup and teardown; clean up any temp files or mocks.
- Mock `process.exit` with `vi.spyOn` when testing guard functions — do not let tests actually exit the process.
- Test files that touch the file system should create a temp directory via `fs.mkdtempSync` and remove it in `afterEach`.
- Match the style of existing tests: short, focused assertions, no commented-out code.
