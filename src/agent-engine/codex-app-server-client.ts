 * Transport for one `codex app-server` child process: spawn, the initialization
 * handshake, JSONL framing, request/response correlation, notification fan-out,
 * server-initiated request delivery, and shutdown.
 *
 * Deliberately TRANSPORT-ONLY. It knows nothing about Telegram, missions,
 * providers, capability profiles, or `AgentEngineEvent`. Threads, turns, per-thread
 * serialization, restart policy and event translation live above it
 * (manager/adapter, Phase 2) so this layer stays testable against a fake child.
 *
 * Not a singleton: `CodexAppServerManager` owns the process-scoped instance.
 * `EngineFactory` builds adapters per call, so an adapter-held child would
 * silently restore the per-turn process model App Server exists to remove.
 *
 * ## Generations
 *
 * This object outlives its child: a crash is followed by a lazy restart, so a
 * second (third, …) child can exist over one client's lifetime. Every spawn gets a
 * monotonically increasing GENERATION, and every callback and deferred continuation
 * captures the generation it belongs to. Anything from a superseded generation is
 * logged and dropped. Without that, a dying child's exit handler clears the state
 * of its healthy replacement, and a slow server-request handler answers generation
 * N-1's request down generation N's stdin — where the id means something else
 * entirely.
