/**
 * Per-provider chat-path tool profiles.
 *
 * Replaces the old binary "Claude = unrestricted, everyone-else = one shared
 * `CHAT_ACP_TOOL_POLICY` bucket" with an explicit profile per provider, so each
 * provider's chat capability is tuned on its own merits. Shared by bot.ts and
 * signal-bot.ts (previously duplicated in both).
 *
 * Data-driven on purpose: the code table is the default; a future dashboard can
 * expose these as per-provider tool checkboxes by layering a persisted override
 * on top (same pattern as the model picker), with no engine changes.
 *
 * Safety intent preserved: non-Claude models tend to read a casual chat message
 * as a coding task (Codex once ran the whole test suite on "hey, wake up"), so
 * they stay read-only for code-exec by default. Web-answer tools (WebSearch,
 * WebFetch) are read-only and safe to grant, so a vetted provider can have them.

 * (mission / schedule / hive) are materialized by the dispatch authorization
 * layer (dispatch-tools.ts) before the engine is called — and only for a turn
 * that grants tools at all, so a deny-all profile here also means no dispatch.
