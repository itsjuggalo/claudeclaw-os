/**
 * War-room tool / MCP policy.
 *
 * The text war-room used to call `query()` with `permissionMode:
 * 'bypassPermissions'`, no `allowedTools` policy, and every MCP server
 * the user has installed. That meant any prompt-injected war-room
 * message could, in principle, drive Chrome, write files, send Slack,
 * or talk to Microsoft 365 without the user noticing — there was no
 * permission UI, no tool allowlist, no MCP scope.
 *
 * This module enforces the boundary:
 *
 *   - Default-allow read-only built-ins: Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch,
 *     WebFetch, TodoWrite. These are safe for "answer in chat" turns.
 *   - Default-deny side-effect built-ins: Bash, Write, Edit,
 *     NotebookEdit, ExitPlanMode, Skill.
 *   - Default-deny every MCP server, browser-driving and email-suite
 *     ones (claude-in-chrome, claude_ai_*) included. filterMcpServers()
 *     drops every server that is not explicitly opted in, so an
 *     unlisted server is never attached to the runtime.
 *   - Per-agent opt-in via `warroom_tools:` in agents/<id>/agent.yaml
 *     (parsed in agent-config.ts). Ops and Comms default to Bash + Skill;
 *     MCP access requires an `mcp:<server>` entry.
 *
 * Operators can customize the per-agent allowlist; the default-deny
 * list is hardcoded so a misconfigured agent.yaml can't accidentally
 * grant browser/M365 access.
